# Tidio Recruitment Task

**Please do not fork the repo, clone it and put it in your own github / gitlab.**

# Task description:
Create the component that is shown in the mockups in figma ([Link](https://www.figma.com/file/7IeOBewCvUmiX7s65Z068f/Front?node-id=1%3A33131)).
If for some reason you have trouble opening the link in figma, you can import the mockup directly from the file. 
The file is located in the main folder under the name `tidio-mockup.fig`.

Design system (font, font sizes and colors) is already prepared. You can preview it in the file `theme/index.ts`.

We appreciate code that is written manually, so avoid including extra dependencies unless they are essential.

## Definition of done:

1. Component should be rendered on route `/accordion`.
2. The component should display images and texts based on the data received from the API. The API is available at URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/chatbot-details`.
3. Component look exactly like the one in the figma.
4. Component should be adapted for mobile devices. The views for these devices are shown in figma.
5. One of the accordions should always be visible.
6. The active and hover state is handled according to the mocks.

Optional: Add simple and smooth animations as you transition between accordions, design choices are yours :)
Optional: Add functional / unit tests using React Testing Library


Good luck and do not hesitate to ask in case of any questions!
